    int blocks[IDX_BLOCKS];
};

There are 126 index blocks. 124 of them are direct blocks. Each direct blocks
point directly to blocks on the file system used for file storage, so the
direct blocks store up to 124 * 512 = 63,488 bytes.

There is one indirect block. This indirect block points to a block containing
128 indices, each of which points to a storage sector on disk. Thus, the
indirect block stores up to 128 * 512 = 65,536 bytes.

Lastly, there is one doubly indirect block. This block points to an index
block, containing 128 indices. Each of these indices points to another index
block, containing 128 indices, pointing directly to storage blocks on disk.
Thus, the doubly indirect block stores up to 128 * 128 * 512 = 8,388,608
bytes.

Thus, in total, our inode structure can support
    63,488
    65,536
   +8,388,608
   ----------
    8,517,632

bytes, equivalent to 8.12 megabytes. Thus, the inode structure supports a
little over 8 megabytes.

A read-write lock mechanism is used to synchronize concurrent reads 
and writes to blocks. This system allows multiple concurrent read
ers, but not writers (or a combination of readers + writers) in t
he same block. Since a file consists of multiple blocks, depending
on what thread obtains the lock first, a reader can either see
the unmodified version of the file (if the readers get the lock first),
or a writer will acquire the lock, modify the file, then the readers
will see the new version of that block (i.e. part of file). In
this way, the readers only read data that the writers write, or
original data that was there before writers wrote (if they get
the lock first); but in this case the writers never wrote, so its OK!

File read/write is done in blocks, i.e. the lock is not in the file-level. 
The locks, too, (read write lock) are granular enough that don't lock the entire
file, but only cached blocks. Hence, this is a major improvement,
especially for big files. Multiple concurrent readers
are allowed without blocking each other, but not writers (or a comination of 
writers and readers).

However, there is no "preemptive fairness", in the sense that writers
won't block new readers from reading (if someone's already reading).
This could be disatvantageous if there are tons of readers/writers 
to the same block. It should not be a big deal for usual disk IO.

The current approach could be extended the following way:
If a writer tried to get the write lock, don't wait for all readers to 
finish, but set up a flag to block future readers (hence only wayt for current readers to finish).

This was not implemented because this sort of fairness wasn't explicitely 
mendioned in the spec (and we have just a couple of hours to 
turn this in, don't wanna mess it up)

Also note that writers can never block readers indefinitely, because there can only be only one writer to the sector with the
write lock. When he finishes, either another writer can get the
lock, or another reader. They are both treader equaly, hence this
case is completely fair.

thread.h: added directories list and a variable to indicate if
the file descriptor is that for a directory or a file.
struct process {
    ...
    bool fd_is_dir[MAX_OPEN_FILES];
    ...
    struct dir * directories[MAX_OPEN_FILES];
};

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

Traversals of absolute and relative paths differ at the start of a
traversal. At the start, the current directory of the traversal
is chosen as "/" if it is an absolute path (first character is '/')
or is chosen as the current working directory otherwise.

Then, a name of the next node is built up and when we've reached
the the end of the node (a '/' character or an NUL '\0' character)
we look for an entry in the current directory with that name.
If we're at the end we make sure we have what we came for and it
is valid. If we're not at the end then we keep looping, advancing
the current directory.

Since directories are read to and written to just like files -- through
inodes -- these simultaneous attempts to remove or create the same file
or directory are theoretically prevented by inode read and write locks.

No, the implementation does not allow a directory to be removed if it
is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current working
directory. We prevent this by checking if the path specified is a
directory with same sector as the current working directory or if
it has same sector as any directory open in the process's array of
open file/directories.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.

The directory structure is almost the same as the initial structure
before the implementation of subdirectories. Now, we search for
files in root by searching the dir entries in directory of represented
by the inode of the root directory sector. The dir entries specify
the sector representing an inode which is a child of that directory.
The dir entries also specify whether the child is a directory or
a file.

We had to stick to this way even though arguably it's better to
specify whether something is a folder or a file in the inode on
disk itself for completeness. Right now it's taken that root /
is a directory because it is hard coded in. Whenever a child is
searched for, we set the is_dir flag of the inode struct based
on the is_dir flag of the corresponding dir_entry struct.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a

As previously mentioned, a read-write lock mechanism is implemented.
To evict a block, a write lock must be acquired for that block. Hence,
if we try to evict a block, we must acquire a write lock => we
must make sure that there are no other processes currently reading
and writing from that block.

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?
A write lock is acquired during eviction. Other readers/writers
have to respectively acquire read/write locks, both of which are
impossible while a write lock is already acquired (for eviction, in that case) 
for that block. Thus, they can't access that block without the eviction finishing.

Note that there is an unfortunate case that during a cache read/write,
a block was just evicted before the reader/writer ever got to acquire
its lock. Thus, the reader/writer always checks for the validity
of the block for which it acquired a lock for (after it get the lock).
If it's valid and the sector_id matches to what it shold be it
goes ahead and does it thing. Otherwise tries again.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.
From buffer cache: Reading/writing to the same block/file a lot. 
For example, if a process reads/writes a lot to the same group
of blocks, they will likely be cached. Hence, the read/write will
be done in cache (memory) rather than disk (which is much slower).

For read-ahead: When a process accesses the file sequentially,
read-ahead adds the possibility that the later accesses are already
cached, hence making them much faster. Thus, sequential access 
processes will benefit.

For write-behind: Write behind is important for two things: 1. It
flushes the cache (if needed) to disk, hence potentially saving
the data in case of an improper shutdown.
2. It could make cache evicts faster. If a process is doing a lot 
of IO (maybe not sequential, or other pattern that makes clock eviction bad)
then there will be a lot of evictions. But if the process is also 
writing, each evicted block will need to be written back. Write-behind
adds the posibility that the block that's being evicted was already
written back previously, hence making evictions faster.
