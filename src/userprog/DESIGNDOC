When process_execute receives the input cmdline string, the first thing we do
is check if the length of that string is less than or equal to the PGSIZE. If
it is, we return TID_ERROR (-1). Then, we immediately make a copy of the 
cmdline input, so we can be sure the caller does not free the string. In 
process execute we also make an additional copy, and using strtok_r, we use 
this second copy to create a string with the file name of the process, which
is passed to thread_create() as the thread name. The function thread_create()
will then execute start_process(), with its argument being the copied cmdline 
string. In start_process(), we tokenize the string using a function called
tokenize_process_args(). This function takes the input string, and creates an
argv array, and also sets the value of argc, an int pointer passed in by 
start_process().

In tokenize_process_args(), we first palloc two memory regions. The first for
storing the tokenized strings themselves, in a contiguous memory region 
starting at the beginning of this string page. The second is for the argv 
array itself -- so it stores pointers to strings in the string page. After
pallocing the pages, we then tokenize the input string with strtok_r. We use 
the space delimiter " ", so each token will be a string stripped of all the 
whitespaces. These are stored in the string page with strlcpy, and we keep
track of an offset in the string page so we know where to write the next 
string. After writing the current token to the string page we increment argc,
then we set argv for the current index to the string we just wrote into the 
string page. After we do this, we set the last value in the argv array to be 
NULL, and then return argv. 

With start_process() now having access to an argv and argc, we check that 
everything can fit onto the stack. We do so by adding up all the bytes taken
up by the arguments on the stack, the word-align, the return address, argc,
as well as well as the argv pointer and all the argv[i] pointers. In addition,
we add argc bytes to take into account the null terminating characters at the
end of each string.

We then pass this information to the load function, which then passes it to 
the setup_stack() function. Here, we keep track of an offset pointer, 
initially set to PHYS_BASE, and we use this pointer to first write all the 
strings onto the stack. After we strlcpy'ing a string in argv onto the stack, 
we then set the value of argv[i] at the current index to be a pointer to this 
new offset, so that argv now points to strings on the stack, so that we can 
use it when we are writing the actual argv array onto the stack, and it won't 
point to strings in the original string page. Then, we write the word-align 0 
onto the stack, then all the pointers to the strings in argv onto the stack, 
then the pointer to argv itself (which is just the memory address of the 
previous byte we wrote to). Then, we write argc, and lastly, the dummy 
return address. We then set *esp to the current offset, and free the old
string page and the argv array. The stack is now set up.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
In the man page for strtok and strtok_r, it says strtok() function uses 
a static buffer while parsing, so it's not thread safe. Thus, two threads
could be writing to the same locations in the static buffer at once. In 
strtok_r, the saveptr allows the user to keep track of its own progress
in parsing the string, so this makes it thread safe.  

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name

An advantage of the unix-like systems' approach is that you spend less time
in the kernel, since the kernel doesn't have to spend time tokenizing the 
commands.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

thread.h: Defined a process struct was created to store process level
information as opposed to thread level information.
struct process {
    tid_t parent_id;
    struct file * exec_file;
    int num_files_open;
    bool open_file_descriptors[MAX_OPEN_FILES];
    struct file * files[MAX_OPEN_FILES];
};

thread.h: Added a process struct, process_details, to the thread struct:
struct thread {
  ...
  struct process * process_details;
  ...
};

thread.c: Global lock used by filesystem syscalls.
struct lock filesys_lock;

A dead_list: keeps track of processes (semaphore, tid, parent_id, exit_status)
of a process that has exited, however not yet been waited on (reaped) by his
parent. 

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File descriptors are an index into an array of struct file pointers located in
the process_details struct of a thread. They are unique within a single
process. A separate array keeps track of which file descriptors are in use.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Reading and writing user data from the kernel happens in several system call
functions. The following functions interact with user data: exec, create,
remove, open, read, and write.

Each is passed some pointer by the user program. The functions first verify
that the pointers (as well as the pointers + some size argument) are in
required range, and that they correpsond to a page directory entry.

Then, the syscall functions proceed with their functionality. The exec
function reads the program execution arguments string through process
functions. create creates a file in the filesystem with the name given to
it by a pointer to a string. Similarly remove deletes the file. Read reads
a file and writes it into a buffer pointer given to it by the user. Write
reads a buffer in the user space and writes given number of bytes to a file.

The write system call is the only system call for which a large amount of
user space data can get copied into the kernel. In this case, we only end
up iterating through that data once. 

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

When a parent process waits for a child, we first have made sure that the 
child is created. This is done in the exec (when exec returns, the child
has actually been created, so it doesn't concern main).

Then, the parent checks in the all_list (if the child is ready/blocked it will
be there). Note that interrupts are disabled while looping that list, as it's a
shared data structure. If it finds it there, it just tried to down the
thread's wait semaphore (initialized to 0). Thus, the parent will
clearly block itself. When the child exits, if its parent is
waiting for it, it does a sema_up (hence lets the parent run and
reap it).

If the child exits and no one has waited for it yet, it is added to a 
dead_list. Then, if the parent decides to wait, it can just look
in the dead list (if it can't find it in all_list), and reap it.

Long story short, each thread has a wait semaphore attached to it, initialzied
to 0, that it can sema_up to signal a waiter (if there is one). If not, just
add yourself to dead_list for later reaping.

Note that we also make sure that the tid argument actually is a child
of the caller, free appropriate pages etc, but I'll not go into boring
details.

We created a wrapper function that validates the pointers given to the syscall
by the user. This avoids a lot of repeated code.

This code essentially checks that the address provided by users is in the
valid range, and that it corresponds to an allocated page. If not, we do
an exit(-1), hence calling thread_exit(), releasing all that thread's
resources.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

Exec calls process_execute(), which does parsing and calls
thread_create(). Thread create then sets up the thread to start at
the desired function, with the desired arguments (the function will then
load the executable). Thus, unfortunately, when we have created a new
thread (hence when we have a new tid returned), the function hasn't
started yet, hence the file isn't actually loaded! So we need some
synchronization...

The way we do it is that each parent (hence thread) has a special 
load_semaphore and loaded_error field. The semaphore is initialized
to 0. Then, in the function (start_process), after the loading is done,
we signal the parent to wake up (it's waiting at the laod_sema), and we
also update the loaded_error field, to indicate any errors.

That way, the parent can actually know whether the process
was stared successfully (go with given tid) or had a loading
error (return -1).

// TODO: BELLO
If P calls wait(C) before C exits, P will wait on C's waiter semaphore
(initialized to 0), until C exits and sema_up-s this semaphore.

If P calls wait(C) after C exits, it won't find it in the all_list, but
it will find it in dead_list, where all the information needed for the
reaping is needed.

When a thread exits, it's struct is always destroyed in schedule() (this was
in pintos before we changed anything). The semaphore is freed by parent after
reaping, or by the child itself if it's being inserted in the dead list.
The dead_list entry is freed after the parent reaps the child. If it never
does, that is never freed. But in a real OS that could be a desired
behaviour (init will inherit those children and reap them), so we may
still wanna keep that information around. It doesn't matter whether
P terminates before or after C exits, the behaviour will be the same.

There arent' any special cases, though this system could be extended to
implement more sophisticated stuff. That is, however, beyond the spec.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

We chose to verify user pointers to be in the users virtual memory space
in addition to verifying that the pointers are in a page currently allocated.
This was the easiest way to implement protection of the kernel from bad
pointers given to it through syscalls by user programs.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

One advantage to keeping an array of size MAX_OPEN_FILES is that there is
easy/fast lookup of file structs corresponding to a file descriptor. There
is no additional allocation required when opening files.

It is however a disadvantage that the process struct is so big even for
processes that don't open files. It takes up an unnecssary amount of space
most of the time.


>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We did not change it.
